            <h2>Large Language Model (LLM)</h2>
            <p>A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on vast amounts of text data in order to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs are capable of performing various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, text classification, language translation, and more. One of the most well-known examples of a large language model is OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, which includes models like GPT-2 and GPT-3. These models have been trained on extensive datasets and have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating text. Using LLMs, developers and researchers can build applications and systems that interact with users in natural language, enabling tasks such as chatbots, language translation services, content generation, and more.</p>
            
            <h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
            <p>Logistic regression is a statistical method used for modeling binary or multi-class classification problems. It is a type of regression analysis where the dependent variable is categorical. Logistic regression models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class based on one or more predictor variables. Despite its name, logistic regression is primarily used for classification rather than regression tasks. It is widely used in various fields, including medicine, finance, marketing, and machine learning.</p>
            
            <h2>Linear Regression</h2>
            <p>Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear. Linear regression aims to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the observed and predicted values. Linear regression is widely used for prediction and forecasting in various fields, including economics, engineering, social sciences, and machine learning.</p>
            
            <h2>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2>
            <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence and linguistics concerned with the interaction between computers and human language. It focuses on the development of algorithms and techniques that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. NLP tasks include text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, question answering, and more. NLP has applications in various domains, including information retrieval, healthcare, customer service, and social media analysis.</p>
            
            <h2>Decision Tree</h2>
            <p>A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature (or attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome (class label or numerical value). Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize, making them suitable for explaining and understanding complex decision-making processes. Decision tree algorithms include ID3, C4.5, CART, and Random Forest. Decision trees are widely used in various domains, including medicine, finance, marketing, and customer relationship management.</p>
            
            <h2>K-Means Clustering</h2>
            <p>K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a predetermined number of clusters. It aims to group similar data points together while keeping dissimilar data points apart. The algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest centroid and then recalculates the centroids based on the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster. K-Means clustering is widely used for customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.</p>
